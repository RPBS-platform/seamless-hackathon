Technical test
==============

1. Check that everyone can see and hear me, camera and screen share.
Don't be shy!!
Volunteer code:
participants = ["chloe","david","dominique","fanny","florent","jessica","magali","pascal","pierre","raphael","stephane","yasaman"]
import random
volunteer = lambda: random.choice(participants)

2. Show deployed instance, via screen
Then check that everyone can see in browser:
https://seamless.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/cloudless/instance/8009795/ctx/index.html
Ask volunteers to change fields

3. Launch locally (show on screen)
seamless-bash
cd ~/seamless-tests/highlevel
ipython3 -i ~/seamless-scripts/serve-graph.py -- share-pdb.seamless share-pdb.zip --status-graph ~/software/seamless/graphs/status-visualization.seamless --add-zip ~/software/seamless/graphs/status-visualization.zip --interactive --mount 1

4. Ask people to go to local version (kill cloudless instance)
Make sure everyone is in live share session
http://localhost:5813
In the IPython prompt:
ctx.code = "grep CA filtered_pdb > RESULT"

5:
- Ask if people can see me type in terminal
- Ask volunteer to type in terminal

6:
ctx.pdb.mount("/tmp/pdb.pdb")
ctx.translate()
Ask to refresh browser
Outside the Docker container: code /tmp/code.bash /tmp/filter_code.bash /tmp/pdb.pdb
Ask volunteers to change files
